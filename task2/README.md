# Task B: Side - Channel Vulnerability and Protection

## Task Overview

The purpose of the task is to help you realize the concept of side - channel and implementation of two common sorting algorithm.

## Task

### Step 1
Open files **bsort.h** and **msort.h** under **/sample/App/** level. Complete all sections needed to run the algorithm. You may not change the function definitions and return type.

### Step 2
Include two algorithm header files into trusted and untrusted resource code files. Please note that, you need to include sum.h from last task to invoke `bar_print` function. Then, compile the whole program as the procedures mentioned in **Task A**.

### Step 3
Run `app`, input the test case following instructions you see.

### Step 4
Record the output by using `script` or screenshot for submission.

### Step 5
Please Modify the function `taskB` in **/sample/App/App.cpp**, and possible codes in other files.Then, run these two algorithms under trusted mode (inside of a Enclave).

## Question
1. What did you observe for two algorithms running? Explain why indices output are different.

1. What did you find about results from untrusted and trusted codes?
